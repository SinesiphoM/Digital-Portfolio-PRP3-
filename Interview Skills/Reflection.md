# Reflection on Mock Interview Video

## Situation
I participated in a recorded mock interview session designed to simulate a real job interview scenario. The interview covered common behavioral and technical questions relevant to my target field. The session was recorded for review and self-assessment purposes.

## Task
My objective was to effectively present myself as a strong candidate by clearly articulating my skills and experiences, demonstrating professional communication and body language, providing structured responses using frameworks like STAR, handling challenging questions with poise, and conveying enthusiasm for the target role.

## Action
To prepare for and engage in the mock interview, I researched common interview questions for the role and prepared concise answers, practiced speaking clearly and maintaining positive non-verbal cues, structured my responses to highlight relevant achievements, listened actively to questions, and requested the session be recorded to enable detailed self-review afterward.

## Result
Upon reviewing the recording, I observed several strengths including my effective use of the STAR method for behavioral questions, confident tone, and specific examples that highlighted my problem-solving skills. Areas for improvement include reducing filler words, providing more concise answers, and developing more relaxed body language. The mock interview was a valuable practice opportunity that highlighted both my preparedness and specific areas to refine before a real interview.
