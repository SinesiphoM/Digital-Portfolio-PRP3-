- Determine the best approach to answering "Tell me about yourself"
- Select the optimal strategy for discussing weaknesses in an interview

## Action
I approached the assessment methodically, spending adequate time on each question as shown by the consistent response times. I read each question carefully and selected answers based on my understanding of interview best practices and professional preparation techniques.

## Result
I achieved a score of 80% on the assessment, correctly answering four out of five questions. The results indicate:
- Strong understanding of most interview fundamentals
- One area requiring improvement in interview methodology knowledge
