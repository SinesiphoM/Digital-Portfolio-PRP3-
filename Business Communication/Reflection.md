# Reflection on Business Communication Assessment

## Situation
I completed a formative assessment on Business Communication on 07 March 2025. The assessment consisted of six multiple-choice questions covering various aspects of professional communication, including the purpose of business communication, non-verbal cues, formal language usage, email tone, and virtual meeting etiquette. I spent approximately 21 minutes completing the assessment and attempted all questions (100% completion rate).

## Task
My objective was to demonstrate understanding of fundamental business communication principles and apply this knowledge to practical scenarios. The assessment required me to:
- Identify the primary purpose of business communication
- Recognize examples of non-verbal communication
- Determine appropriate contexts for formal language
- Select the recommended tone for business emails
- Understand proper etiquette for virtual backgrounds in video conferencing

## Action
I approached the assessment systematically, taking time to consider each question carefully as evidenced by the 21-minute completion time. For each question, I:
- Analyzed the question requirements before selecting an answer
- Applied knowledge of business communication best practices
- Made selections based on professional standards rather than personal preference
- Maintained focus throughout the assessment to ensure completion

## Result
I achieved a score of 100% on the assessment, correctly answering all six questions. The results show:
- Perfect score across all communication domains covered
- Consistent correct responses to questions about communication purpose, non-verbal cues, and professional tone
- Demonstrated understanding of both traditional and digital communication etiquette
- Efficient time management while maintaining accuracy
