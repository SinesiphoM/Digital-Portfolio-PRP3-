# Reflection on Professional Networking Assessment

## Situation
I completed a formative assessment on Professional Networking on 29 March 2025. The submission was late. The assessment contained questions about networking principles, events, etiquette, and common mistakes. I spent 19 minutes and 24 seconds completing it and attempted all questions.

## Task
My objective was to demonstrate a clear understanding of professional networking concepts. The assessment required me to:
- Identify the primary purpose of professional networking
- Define what a "networking event" typically refers to
- Recall the "golden rule" of networking
- Recognize common mistakes to avoid in professional networking

## Action
I engaged with the assessment thoroughly, as indicated by the significant time spent relative to the number of questions. I considered each question carefully to apply my knowledge of effective networking strategies and professional relationship-building.

## Result
I achieved a score of 80%, correctly answering four out of five questions. The results show:
- A strong grasp of the core purpose and rules of professional networking
- Understanding of networking event types and common pitfalls
- One area where my answer was incorrect, indicating a knowledge gap
- Full completion of the assessment despite the late submission
