# Reflection on Workplace Etiquette Assessment

## Situation
I completed a formative assessment on Workplace Etiquette on 29 March 2025. The assessment was submitted late and consisted of five multiple-choice questions covering various aspects of professional conduct in workplace settings. Topics included handling difficult emails, meeting punctuality, confidential information management, personal phone usage, and early departure protocols. I spent approximately 11 minutes completing all questions.

My objective was to demonstrate understanding of appropriate workplace behaviors and professional etiquette standards. The assessment required me to:
- Determine proper responses to rude or offensive work emails
- Identify appropriate arrival times for scheduled meetings
- Understand protocols for handling confidential information
- Recognize acceptable personal phone usage during work hours
- Know the correct procedure for leaving work early for personal reasons

## Action
I approached the assessment efficiently, completing it in 11 minutes with 100% question attempt rate. My approach included:
- Making prompt decisions on each question as evidenced by the 1-second response times
- Applying logical reasoning to workplace scenarios
- Drawing on understanding of professional standards and common workplace policies
- Ensuring all questions were addressed despite the late submission

## Result
I achieved a score of 80% on the assessment, correctly answering four out of five questions. The results show:
